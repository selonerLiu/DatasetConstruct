# topicï¼šParameter Matching: Function/destructor call requirements(Parameter count matching, Type consistency), Destructor-function constraints.

Below is a set of 10 multiple-choice questions designed to test students' understanding of the topic: "Parameter Matching: Function/destructor call requirements (Parameter count matching, Type consistency), Destructor-function constraints." These questions are based on the provided content, focusing on key concepts such as the number of parameters in function or destructor calls, the consistency of types for arguments, and constraints on destructors (e.g., rewrite rules, failure conditions, and associated requirements).

Each question is clearly described, with plausible distractors as options (i.e., options that are reasonable but incorrect based on common misconceptions or partial understandings from the content). The questions are distinct from one another, and I have followed the specified format for consistency.

**1. In the context of destructor calls, what must be ensured regarding the number of arguments provided to a destructor like g?**  
A) The number of arguments can vary as long as they are of the correct type.  
B) The number of arguments must exactly match the arity k specified in the destructor's rewrite rules.  
C) Only one argument is required, regardless of the destructor's definition.  
D) The number of arguments can be optional if the destructor is part of a simple pattern.  
**Answer:** B

**2. When defining rewrite rules for a destructor, what type consistency requirement applies to the arguments of g across all rules?**  
A) Arguments in different rules can have different types as long as they are constructors.  
B) All arguments of g in every rule must have the same types as those in other rules for the same destructor.  
C) Type consistency is only needed for the return values, not the arguments.  
D) Arguments must match the types of built-in destructors like 'not' or '='.  
**Answer:** B

**3. What happens if the parameters in a destructor call, such as g(M1,1, ..., M1,k), do not meet the type consistency requirements specified in the rewrite rules?**  
A) The call proceeds with type conversion automatically.  
B) ProVerif attempts to apply the next rewrite rule in the sequence.  
C) The destructor fails, and the term is not reduced.  
D) The parameters are implicitly adjusted to match the required types.  
**Answer:** C

**4. For a type converter function, what constraint ensures type consistency during pattern-matching?**  
A) The output must be the same as the input type, and no checking is needed.  
B) The output must differ from the input, identify the function applied, and be checked upon pattern-matching.  
C) Type consistency is only required if there are multiple converter functions.  
D) The function can produce values of any type without verification.  
**Answer:** B

**5. In the case of a simple pattern, what parameter matching requirement must be met for occurrences of =D?**  
A) D must be a may-fail constructor term, but parameter count can be flexible.  
B) D must be a may-fail constructor term with exact parameter count and type consistency.  
C) Only the type of D needs to match, regardless of the number of parameters.  
D) D can be any term, as long as it does not contain destructor symbols.  
**Answer:** B

**6. When using a data constructor f with associated destructors, what must be ensured for pattern matching of terms like f(M1, ..., Mn)?**  
A) The patterns pat1, ..., patn must match M1, ..., Mn in type but not necessarily in count.  
B) The number of patterns must match the arity n of f, and each must be consistent in type with the corresponding Mi.  
C) Pattern matching works even if f is not a data constructor, as long as types are similar.  
D) Only the first pattern needs to match for the entire term to succeed.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**7. Regarding destructor-function constraints, what condition must be met for the return values in rewrite rules like g(M1,1, ..., M1,k) = M1,0?**  
A) The return values can have different types across rules for variety.  
B) All return values (e.g., M1,0, ..., Mm,0) must share the same type as specified for the destructor's output.  
C) Return values only need to match the types of the arguments, not among themselves.  
D) Type consistency is not required if the destructor is public.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**8. In ProVerif, when encountering a term with a destructor like 'equal(M, N)', what parameter matching rule applies if the rewrite rules fail?**  
A) ProVerif will loop indefinitely until a match is found.  
B) The destructor fails, and the process continues as if the term evaluation failed.  
C) Parameters M and N can be of any type, as long as their count matches.  
D) ProVerif automatically adjusts the parameters for type consistency.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. For function macros in ProVerif, what requirement ensures proper parameter handling when defining a symbol for repeated terms?**  
A) The macro can have a variable number of parameters without type checks.  
B) Parameters must maintain type consistency with the original terms, and the count must match the macro's definition.  
C) Only constructors need parameter matching; destructors in macros are exempt.  
D) Type consistency is checked only during pattern-matching, not at definition.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**10. What key constraint differentiates destructors from constructors in terms of parameter matching and failure?**  
A) Destructors allow flexible parameter counts, while constructors do not.  
B) Destructors must follow rewrite rules with exact parameter count and type consistency, and they fail if no rule applies.  
C) Constructors can fail if types are inconsistent, but destructors always succeed.  
D) Parameter matching is optional for both, but only destructors require public declaration.  
**Answer:** B

These questions are designed to vary in focus: some emphasize parameter count (e.g., Questions 1 and 6), others highlight type consistency (e.g., Questions 2 and 7), and several address destructor-specific constraints (e.g., Questions 3 and 8). The distractors are plausible, drawing from related concepts in the content (e.g., misconceptions about flexibility in parameter counts or automatic adjustments). This set should effectively assess students' comprehension of the topic.
