Below is a set of 10 multiple-choice questions designed to test students' understanding of the topic: "Theoretical and Methodological Foundations for Authentication Verification: Representation and verification of authentication properties using corresponding assertions." These questions are based on the provided content, which discusses concepts like correspondence assertions, secrecy, authentication in handshake protocols, tools such as ProVerif and Tamarin, and their applications.

Each question is clearly described, has four plausible distractors (options that are logically related but incorrect), and is unique. The format follows the example you provided, with the answer clearly stated at the end (e.g., **Answer:** B).

**1. In the context of handshake protocols, what is the primary purpose of correspondence assertions for authentication?**  
A) To ensure that messages are encrypted securely without any verification.  
B) To confirm that if one event (e.g., e1) has been executed, another event (e.g., e2) has or will be executed.  
C) To limit the number of sessions in a protocol to prevent overload.  
D) To verify secrecy properties only, ignoring authentication entirely.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**2. According to the content, how does ProVerif verify authentication properties like those in handshake protocols?**  
A) By manually checking each protocol step without any translation.  
B) By translating the protocol into Horn clauses and checking derivability queries for properties like correspondence assertions.  
C) By simulating a bounded number of sessions and ignoring unbounded scenarios.  
D) By focusing solely on observational equivalence without considering secrecy.  
**Answer:** B

**3. What role do tools like ProVerif and Tamarin play in verifying authentication properties for an unbounded number of sessions?**  
A) They restrict analysis to a single session to simplify verification.  
B) They allow verification of protocols for an unbounded number of sessions, often using lemmas to guide proofs.  
C) They only verify secrecy and ignore authentication in unbounded environments.  
D) They require manual intervention for all properties, making automation impossible.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**4. In the handshake protocol example, what must be proven using correspondence assertions to ensure authentication?**  
A) That all messages are kept secret regardless of events.  
B) That if the client thinks they are executing the protocol with a server, that server is indeed the one involved.  
C) That the protocol works only for bounded message spaces.  
D) That encryption primitives are subterm convergent without any event checks.  
**Answer:** B

**5. How does ProVerif handle the verification of security properties, such as authentication via correspondence assertions?**  
A) It verifies them manually by building clauses based on user input.  
B) It automatically translates protocols into Horn clauses and uses resolution to prove properties like "if e1 occurs, then e2 occurs."  
C) It relies exclusively on temporal first-order logic without any clause-based approach.  
D) It only supports bounded sessions and cannot handle equivalences.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**6. Based on the content, what limitation does ProVerif have when verifying protocols in the computational model?**  
A) It can fully automate proofs for all properties without any restrictions.  
B) It cannot fully prove required properties automatically due to certain aspects not being accounted for, though it handles key parts like correspondence assertions.  
C) It is limited to verifying only secrecy and ignores authentication entirely.  
D) It requires an unbounded message space but fails in attack reconstruction.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**7. In examples like the certified email protocol, how are correspondence assertions applied to verify authentication?**  
A) They are used to prove secrecy only, without linking events.  
B) They verify that specific events in the protocol correspond, ensuring authentication as shown in works like Abadi & Blanchet.  
C) They focus on privacy and traceability without any event-based checks.  
D) They are applied manually without any tool support.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**8. What key advantage does ProVerif provide for analyzing protocols like the JFK key exchange?**  
A) It verifies protocols by combining manual proofs with automatic checks of correspondences and equivalences.  
B) It ignores correspondences and focuses only on computational soundness.  
C) It restricts analysis to trusted environments and avoids untrusted systems.  
D) It proves properties without translating them into any internal representation.  
**Answer:** A  
---
**9. According to the content, how does the use of Horn clauses contribute to verifying authentication properties?**  
A) They are used to manually build proofs without systematic translation.  
B) They provide a systematic translation from formal protocol models, allowing verification of properties beyond just secrecy.  
C) They are only applicable to bounded sessions and not for authentication.  
D) They focus on subterm convergent equations without addressing correspondences.  
**Answer:** B  
---
**10. In the context of tools like Tamarin, what is required to verify trace properties for authentication in protocols?**  
A) It verifies properties automatically without any user input.  
B) It often needs the user to provide lemmas to guide the proof for an unbounded number of sessions.  
C) It limits verification to secrecy and avoids authentication altogether.  
D) It relies on computational models exclusively, ignoring symbolic ones.  
**Answer:** B
