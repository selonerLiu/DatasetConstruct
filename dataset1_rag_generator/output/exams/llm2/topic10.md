# topic：Expressions (Terms): Composition of operators/operands (variables, constants, function calls) into evaluable units, including Function applications, or Tuple constructions.

Below is a set of 10 multiple-choice questions designed to test students' understanding of the topic: "Expressions (Terms): Composition of operators/operands (variables, constants, function calls) into evaluable units, including Function applications, or Tuple constructions." These questions are based on the provided content, focusing on key concepts such as how expressions are formed, evaluated, and extended with constructs like destructors, function applications, and tuple constructions.

Each question is clearly described, with plausible distractors as options (i.e., the wrong answers are reasonable but incorrect based on the content). The questions are distinct from one another, and the format follows the example you provided.

**1. In the context of expressions, what are the basic building blocks for composing an evaluable unit like a function application?**  
A) Only variables and constants, without any operators.  
B) Variables, constants, function calls, and tuple constructions.  
C) Names and events, but not function applications.  
D) Destructors and rewrite rules only.  
**Answer:** B

**2. When composing a tuple in an expression, how is it typically constructed according to the content?**  
A) Using a constructor like tupleT1,...,Tn(M1,...,Mn) to group terms.  
B) Directly as a variable without any specific syntax.  
C) By applying a destructor to combine multiple terms.  
D) Through conditional statements like if-then-else.  
**Answer:** A

**3. What must be true for an expression to be considered ground when composing operators and operands?**  
A) It must contain no variables, only constants and function calls.  
B) It can include variables as long as they are declared.  
C) It should always evaluate to fail for security reasons.  
D) It must include at least one destructor or rewrite rule.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**4. In expressions, how are function applications incorporated into the composition of operators and operands?**  
A) By using the syntax h(D1,...,Dn) where h is from Fd ∪ Fc, applied to subexpressions.  
B) Only through variables, without any specific function symbols.  
C) By restricting them with new a: T; D before use.  
D) Exclusively in processes, not in standalone expressions.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**5. When evaluating a composed expression involving a destructor like g(U1,...,Un), what happens if no rewrite rule applies?**  
A) The expression evaluates to the constant fail.  
B) It automatically defaults to a ground term.  
C) The evaluation continues indefinitely until a rule matches.  
D) It transforms into a conditional statement.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**6. How does the 'let' construct contribute to composing expressions with function applications or tuple constructions?**  
A) It allows binding a value to a variable, such as let x: T = D in D′ else D′′, enabling further composition.  
B) It restricts the expression to only ground terms.  
C) It is used solely for declaring new names, not for expressions.  
D) It evaluates expressions without any error handling.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**7. In the composition of expressions, what role do associative and commutative operators play, as mentioned in the content?**  
A) They allow for flexible ordering of operands in function applications, like in Diﬃe-Hellman exponentiation.  
B) They are only used in processes and not in expressions.  
C) They must be avoided to prevent evaluation failures.  
D) They convert expressions into ground terms automatically.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**8. When composing an expression with a conditional like if D then D′ else D′′, what is the key condition for it to succeed?**  
A) D must evaluate to true; otherwise, it fails or uses the else branch.  
B) D must be a ground term, regardless of its value.  
C) The expression must include a destructor for evaluation.  
D) It always succeeds as long as variables are present.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**9. For tuple constructions in expressions, which of the following best describes how operands like terms M1,...,Mn are combined?**  
A) As a constructor application, such as tupleT1,...,Tn(M1,...,Mn), to form a single evaluable unit.  
B) By using pattern-matching directly without constructors.  
C) Through replication or parallel composition in processes.  
D) Only if they are non-ground terms for flexibility.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**10. In the evaluation of composed expressions, what distinguishes constructors from destructors in terms of their application?**  
A) Constructors build terms like f(M1,...,Mk) for composition, while destructors use rewrite rules like g(U1,...,Un) → U.  
B) Constructors always fail, whereas destructors always succeed.  
C) Constructors are only for ground terms, and destructors for variables.  
D) There is no difference; both are used interchangeably.  
**Answer:** A
