# topicï¼šIdentifiers: Specifications for constructing variable/function names: Character set, First-character rules, Length restrictions, Keyword reservation policies, and so on.

Below is a set of 10 multiple-choice questions designed to test students' understanding of the topic: "Identifiers: Specifications for constructing variable/function names." These questions are based on the provided content, focusing on aspects such as character set, first-character rules, length restrictions, keyword reservation policies, case sensitivity, and related declaration rules.

Each question is clearly described, with plausible distractors as options (i.e., incorrect answers that are believable based on common misconceptions or partial truths from the content). The questions are distinct from one another, and the format follows the example you provided.

**1. According to the specifications, what characters can be included in an identifier after the first character?**  
A) Only letters (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9).  
B) Letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscores (_), single-quotes ('), and accented letters from the ISO Latin 1 character set.  
C) Any printable characters, as long as the identifier is not a reserved word.  
D) Letters and digits only, with no special characters like underscores.  
**Answer:** B

**2. What rule applies to the first character of an identifier in the language?**  
A) It must be a digit or a letter.  
B) It must be a letter, which can include accented letters from the ISO Latin 1 character set.  
C) It can be any character, including underscores or digits, as long as the rest is valid.  
D) It must be an uppercase letter to distinguish it from reserved words.  
**Answer:** B

**3. Are there any length restrictions specified for identifiers in the language?**  
A) Identifiers must be at most 32 characters long.  
B) There are no explicit length restrictions; they can be an unlimited sequence of allowed characters.  
C) Identifiers must be at least 1 character but no more than 64 characters.  
D) The length is limited to the number of characters in reserved words.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**4. How does the language handle keyword reservation policies for identifiers?**  
A) Identifiers can reuse reserved words as long as they are prefixed with an underscore.  
B) Identifiers must be distinct from reserved words, such as "channel" or "if".  
C) Reserved words can be used as identifiers in certain contexts, like comments.  
D) Only built-in types like "bool" are reserved, but other keywords can be reused.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**5. In what way are identifiers case sensitive according to the specifications?**  
A) They are not case sensitive, so "Variable" and "variable" are considered the same.  
B) They are case sensitive, meaning "Variable" and "variable" are distinct identifiers.  
C) Case sensitivity applies only to the first character of the identifier.  
D) Identifiers become case insensitive when used in declarations.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**6. What must be considered when declaring names or variables as identifiers?**  
A) They can be declared without specifying a type, as long as they are not reserved words.  
B) They must be declared with their type, such as in a "new a : t;" statement.  
C) Types are optional for variables but required for names.  
D) Declaration is only needed if the identifier is used in a function symbol.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**7. In noninterf declarations, what restriction applies to identifiers used as function symbols?**  
A) Only constructors can be used as identifiers, and names are not allowed.  
B) Any identifiers can be used, including reserved words for convenience.  
C) Only names are allowed as identifiers, but not constructors.  
D) Identifiers must include digits in noninterf declarations.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**8. What is recommended regarding the reuse of built-in identifiers like "bool" or "nat" as user-defined identifiers?**  
A) It is encouraged to reuse them to save space in the code.  
B) It is strongly discouraged, as it can lead to confusion in the language.  
C) Built-in identifiers can be reused freely in comments or nested structures.  
D) They must be reused with a prefix, such as "user_bool".  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. How do comments interact with identifier rules in the language?**  
A) Comments can include reserved words, which then become valid identifiers.  
B) Comments are surrounded by (* and *), and they do not affect identifier validity, but identifiers inside comments are still checked.  
C) Any identifier used in a comment is automatically reserved and cannot be used elsewhere.  
D) Nested comments allow identifiers to bypass first-character rules.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**10. In the context of identifiers for variables, what additional rule applies to their usage in rewrite rules?**  
A) Variables as identifiers can include names without any restrictions.  
B) Variables must not contain names, and their types must match the arguments they substitute.  
C) Variables can be substituted by any term, regardless of type declarations.  
D) Only may-fail variables can be used as identifiers in rewrite rules.  
**Answer:** B
