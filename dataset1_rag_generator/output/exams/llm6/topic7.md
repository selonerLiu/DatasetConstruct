B) The ProVerif compiler will automatically insert the necessary whitespace.
C) It may lead to a syntax error as the compiler may not be able to distinguish between different elements.

B) Too much whitespace can cause the code to run slower.
C) Spaces, tabs, and newlines can be used to separate different parts of an expression.
D) The use of whitespace follows certain rules to ensure correct parsing.
**Answer:** B

**5. In a ProVerif code, if you write two keywords right next to each other without any whitespace, what will the compiler do?**
A) It will assume that one of the keywords is a misspelled identifier.
B) It will generate a warning and try to correct the code by inserting whitespace.
C) It will throw a syntax error because it cannot parse the code correctly.

**Answer:** C

**6. Which of the following is a correct way to use whitespace in a ProVerif process declaration?**
A) Write all parts of the process on a single line without any spaces.
B) Use spaces to separate the different components of the process, like separating an output operation from the rest of the process.
C) Use only tabs and avoid spaces altogether.

**Answer:** B
---
**7. Regarding comments in ProVerif, which of the following is true?**
A) Comments can be nested within other comments.
B) Comments can contain ProVerif code, but it will be ignored.
C) Comments can only be placed at the beginning of a file.
D) Comments must be written in uppercase letters.
**Answer:** B

**8. If you use an inconsistent mix of spaces and tabs for indentation in a ProVerif code, what is the likely outcome?**
A) The code will not compile due to an indentation error.
B) The compiler will automatically standardize the indentation to either spaces or tabs.
C) It may make the code harder to read, but it should not cause a syntax error.
D) The code will run, but the results may be incorrect.
**Answer:** C
---
**9. What is the main purpose of using comments in ProVerif?**
A) To make the code look more professional.
B) To provide explanations for the code, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand.
C) To add hidden functionality to the code that is not visible to the compiler.
D) To increase the security of the code by obfuscating certain parts.
**Answer:** B
---
**10. In ProVerif, can you use whitespace to break a long line of code into multiple lines?**
A) No, each line of code must be written as a single, unbroken statement.
B) Yes, but you need to use a special character to indicate the line - break.
C) Yes, you can use spaces, tabs, or newlines to break a long line, as long as the code remains syntactically correct.
D) Only newlines can be used to break a long line, and spaces and tabs are not allowed.
