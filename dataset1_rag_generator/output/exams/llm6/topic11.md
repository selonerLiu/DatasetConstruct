**1. Which of the following represents the null process in ProVerif?**
A) `!P`
B) `0`
C) `P | Q`
D) `new n : t; P`
**Answer:** B
---
**2. In ProVerif, what does the `in(M, x: t); P` construct do?**
A) It outputs the message `M` on the channel `x`.
B) It inputs a message on the channel `M` and binds it to the variable `x`, then runs `P`.
C) It creates a new name `n` of type `t` and runs `P`.
D) It replicates the process `P`.
**Answer:** B
---
**3. What is the purpose of the `phase n; P` construct in ProVerif?**
A) It creates a new phase of the process `P` without any synchronization.
B) It acts as a global synchronization; processes not reaching a `phase n` construct with `n ≥ 1` are discarded, and processes starting with `phase 1` run.
C) It terminates the process `P` when the phase `n` is reached.
D) It restricts the process `P` to run only in phase `n`.
**Answer:** B

**4. Which construct in ProVerif is used for parallel composition of processes?**
A) `!P`
B) `P | Q`
C) `if M then P else Q`
D) `event(e(M1,...,M n)); P`
**Answer:** B
---
**5. In ProVerif, what does the `out(M, N); P` construct represent?**
A) It inputs a message on the channel `M` and binds it to `N`, then runs `P`.
B) It outputs the message `N` on the channel `M`, then runs `P`.
C) It creates a new name `N` of type `M` and runs `P`.
D) It checks if `M` is equal to `N` and then runs `P`.
**Answer:** B
---
**6. What is the function of the `if M then P else Q` construct in ProVerif?**
A) It always runs both `P` and `Q` regardless of the value of `M`.
B) It runs `P` if `M` is true, otherwise it runs `Q`.
C) It creates a new name if `M` is true and runs `P`, otherwise it runs `Q`.
D) It replicates `P` if `M` is true, otherwise it replicates `Q`.
**Answer:** B
---
**7. The `new n : t; P` construct in ProVerif is used for: **
A) Outputting a new message `n` of type `t` on the channel `P`.
B) Inputting a new message `n` of type `t` from the channel `P`.
C) Restricting the scope of a new name `n` of type `t` within the process `P`.
D) Replicating the process `P` with a new name `n` of type `t`.
**Answer:** C
---
**8. In ProVerif, the `!P` construct is used to: **
A) Terminate the process `P`.
B) Replicate the process `P` indefinitely.
C) Check if the process `P` is valid.
D) Create a new phase for the process `P`.
**Answer:** B
---
**9. Which of the following is an auxiliary event construct in ProVerif used to specify security properties?**
A) `event(e(M1,...,M n)); P`
B) `begin(M).P`
C) `phase n; P`
D) `in(M, x: t); P`
**Answer:** B
---
**10. What does the `let x: T = D in D′ else D′′` construct in ProVerif do?**
A) It outputs the value of `D` to the variable `x` of type `T` and then runs `D′` if `D` is valid, otherwise `D′′`.
B) It inputs a value from `D` and binds it to the variable `x` of type `T`, then runs `D′` if `D` is true, otherwise `D′′`.
C) It evaluates the expression `D` and binds the result to the variable `x` of type `T`, then runs `D′`; if the evaluation fails, it runs `D′′`.
D) It creates a new name `x` of type `T` and runs `D′` if `D` is a valid name, otherwise `D′′`.
**Answer:** C
