# topicï¼šStructural Units: Organization of processes and process macros into larger code blocks to implement protocol workflows.Definition and usage methods for processes and process macros in ProVerif.

---
**1. In ProVerif, how are sub-processes specified to facilitate the development of protocols instead of encoding everything into a single main process?**  
A) By using global variables shared among processes.  
B) By declaring process macros of the form `let R(x1 : t1, ..., xn : tn) = P`.  
C) By writing each subprocess in a separate input file.  
D) By defining phases that synchronize all subprocesses.  
**Answer:** B

**2. What is the purpose of the free name declaration syntax `free n : t.` in ProVerif input files?**  
A) To define a type alias for `t`.  
B) To declare a name `n` with its associated type `t`.  
C) To create a macro with name `n`.  
D) To mark `n` as a private variable within a process.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**3. Which of the following best describes the effect of expanding a macro invocation such as `R(M1, ..., Mn)` in ProVerif?**  
A) It creates a new process that is unrelated to the macro definition.  
B) It replaces the invocation with the sub-process `P` where variables `x1, ..., xn` are substituted by `M1, ..., Mn`.  
C) It generates a comment in the output to document the macro use.  
D) It discards the macro and proceeds with only the main process.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**4. How does ProVerif handle multiple copies of a process when the process is under replication?**  
A) It merges all copies into a single process without distinction.  
B) Each copy is assigned a unique name (such as "a n") to track executions independently.  
C) Replication is not supported in ProVerif.  
D) It halts with an error as replicated processes are ambiguous.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**5. What is the main reason for using process macros in ProVerif models according to the given content?**  
A) To simplify the representation and make protocol development easier.  
B) To improve runtime performance of the ProVerif tool.  
C) To reduce the number of types needed in the model.  
D) To enforce higher security assumptions automatically.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**6. In the phrase `let R' (y : bitstring) = 0.` from a ProVerif model, what does this syntax represent?**  
A) A macro named R' with a parameter y of type bitstring that equals the process 0 (inactive).  
B) A free name declaration for R'.  
C) A type declaration for bitstring named R'.  
D) A recursive process definition incorrectly formatted.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**7. What is the effect of the `phase n; P phase` construct in ProVerif process definitions?**  
A) It marks `P` to start only when the global protocol phase is `n`, synchronizing all processes accordingly.  
B) It declares a macro called `phase`.  
C) It repeats the process `P` `n` times.  
D) It creates a concurrent thread that runs independent of phases.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**8. Which of the following statements regarding types in ProVerif is correct?**  
A) Types do not need to be declared explicitly; any variable can assume any type.  
B) User-defined types are declared using the syntax `type t.`  
C) Only the type `bitstring` is supported in ProVerif models.  
D) Types are declared inside process bodies, not in declarations.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**9. When a macro is defined with the syntax `def name(i1,...,in) { declarations }`, what is the meaning of calling `name(a1,...,an)` in ProVerif?**  
A) It calls an external process named `name`.  
B) It expands to the declarations inside `def` with `i1,...,in` substituted by `a1,...,an`.  
C) It creates a new free name called `name`.  
D) It triggers an error because `def` cannot be invoked this way.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**10. How does ProVerif present the internal representation of a process when macros are used?**  
A) It outputs the process with all macros expanded and assigns unique identifiers to names and variables.  
B) It shows only the macro names without expansions.  
C) It hides the internal details to simplify the output.  
D) It prints the process partially expanded to prevent confusion.  
**Answer:** A
