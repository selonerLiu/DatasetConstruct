**1. Which of the following constructs in ProVerif is used to model a process that does nothing?**  
A) `!P` (replication)  
B) `0` (nil/null process)  
C) `in(M, x); P` (input process)  
D) `out(M, N); P` (output process)  
**Answer:** B  
---

**2. What is the purpose of the `new n: t; P` construct in a ProVerif process?**  
A) To output the name `n` of type `t` on a public channel.  
B) To introduce a fresh name `n` of type `t` with restricted scope in process `P`.  
C) To replicate process `P` infinitely many times.  
D) To test if `n` equals type `t`.  
**Answer:** B

**3. In ProVerif, which construct allows conditional execution depending on some term `M`?**  
A) `if M then P else Q`  
B) `let x = M in P`  
C) `new M; P`  
D) `event(M); P`  
**Answer:** A  
---

**4. What does the `out(M, N); P` process do in ProVerif?**  
A) Outputs message `N` on channel `M`, then continues as process `P`.  
B) Inputs message `N` from channel `M`, then continues as process `P`.  
C) Defines a constant `M` equal to `N`, then executes `P`.  
D) Replicates process `P` with messages `M` and `N`.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**5. How does ProVerif represent infinite replication of a process `P`?**  
A) `0`  
B) `!P`  
C) `P | P`  
D) `phase n; P`  
**Answer:** B  
---

**6. The `in(M, x: t); P` construct is used to:**  
A) Send the value `x` of type `t` on channel `M` and then run `P`.  
B) Receive a message on channel `M`, bind it to variable `x` of type `t`, then run `P`.  
C) Restrict name `x` of type `t` globally.  
D) Test whether `M` equals `x` before executing `P`.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**7. What happens inside ProVerif when an `event(e(M1, ..., Mn)); P` construct executes?**  
A) The execution of event `e(M1, ..., Mn)` is logged but does not affect the process flow, then `P` runs.  
B) The process terminates immediately without running `P`.  
C) The event replaces `P` in the execution.  
D) The event causes a conditional branch in the process.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**8. Why is the `phase n; P` construct used in ProVerif models?**  
A) To declare new constants within process `P`.  
B) To synchronize processes globally, allowing processes only in the current phase to run.  
C) To model input/output blocking on channel `n`.  
D) To replicate `P` `n` times.  
**Answer:** B  
---

**9. Which of the following best describes parallel composition in ProVerif?**  
A) `P | Q` runs processes `P` and `Q` concurrently.  
B) `P | Q` means process `Q` replaces process `P`.  
C) `P | Q` means sequential execution of `P` then `Q`.  
D) `P | Q` defines a choice between processes `P` and `Q`.  
**Answer:** A  
---

**10. What is the main reason for using `let x: T = D in D' else D''` in process expressions in ProVerif?**  
A) To model input operations.  
B) To perform expression evaluation with conditional branching based on the success of evaluation.  
C) To define new events.  
D) To send messages over a restricted channel.  
**Answer:** B
