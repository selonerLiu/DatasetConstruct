**1. What is the primary purpose of correspondence assertions in the verification of authentication properties?**  
A) To ensure data confidentiality during message exchanges.  
B) To prove that if one event has occurred, then a related event has also occurred or will occur.  
C) To encrypt messages between communicating parties.  
D) To simulate attacker behavior in protocol analysis.  
**Answer:** B

**2. In the handshake protocol discussed, what does authentication guarantee about the interaction between client A and server B?**  
A) Client A always sends encrypted messages to server B.  
B) Client A genuinely communicates with server B, not an impostor.  
C) Server B can decrypt any message sent by client A.  
D) The messages are sent only once during the session.  
**Answer:** B

**Answer:** C

**5. What is the significance of the computational soundness results mentioned with respect to ProVerif?**  
A) They guarantee that any symbolic proof automatically implies real-world cryptographic security for all protocols.  
B) They show that, for restricted protocols using public-key encryption, symbolic proofs imply security in the computational model.

**7. What role do correspondence assertions play in the formal proof of authentication within a protocol?**  
A) They mandate message encryption standards.  
B) They link specific execution events to guarantee authenticity relationships.  
C) They verify key lengths used in the protocol.  
D) They ensure message delivery order.  
**Answer:** B

---
**8. Why is it important that protocol verification tools handle an unbounded number of sessions and message spaces?**  
A) To speed up verification by ignoring session limits.  
B) To model realistic adversary capabilities and long-running protocol executions.  
C) Because the tools are designed only for theoretical examples.  
D) To simplify the translation into Horn clauses.  
**Answer:** B

---
**9. What main advantage does ProVerif have over manual protocol verification methods?**  
A) It eliminates the need for any underlying cryptographic assumptions.  
B) It automatically translates protocols into a format suitable for automated analysis.  
C) It guarantees no attacks exist on any protocol with no exceptions.  
D) It requires less hardware resources than manual proofs.  
**Answer:** B

**10. Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the Dolev-Yao model and the computational model in ProVerif's verification framework?**  
A) The Dolev-Yao model is strictly stronger than the computational model.  
B) A proof in the Dolev-Yao symbolic model implies security in the computational model for a restricted class of protocols.  
C) The computational model ignores public-key encryption, unlike the Dolev-Yao model.  
D) ProVerif cannot perform analysis in the computational model at all.  
**Answer:** B
