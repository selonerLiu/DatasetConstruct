**3. What is the effect of expanding a process macro in ProVerif?**
A) It creates a new process with the same name.
B) It replaces the macro with its definition in the main process.
C) It declares new free names and variables.

**5. How do phases work in ProVerif?**
A) All processes run in parallel and phases are ignored.
B) Processes that did not reach a phase construct are discarded.
C) Phases are used to define new cryptographic primitives.
D) Phases are used to specify the security assumptions on primitives.

**Answer:** B

---
**6. What is the purpose of the `def` keyword in ProVerif?**
A) To define new cryptographic primitives.
B) To specify the security assumptions on primitives.
C) To define a macro for security assumptions on primitives.
D) To declare free names and variables.

**Answer:** C

---
**7. How are security assumptions on primitives defined in ProVerif?**
A) Using the syntax `def name(i1,..., in) { declarations }`.
B) Using the syntax `let name(i1,..., in) = declarations`.
C) Using the syntax `process name(i1,..., in) = declarations`.
D) Using the syntax `macro name(i1,..., in) = declarations`.

**Answer:** A

**8. What is the purpose of the `[Equations]` section in ProVerif's output?**
A) To display the input process with all macros expanded.
B) To summarize the internal representation of the equations given in the input file.
C) To display the security assumptions on primitives.
D) To declare free names and variables.

**Answer:** B

---
**9. What is the purpose of the `[Process]` section in ProVerif's output?**
A) To display the input process with all macros expanded.

**10. What happens to processes that did not reach a phase construct with a higher phase number in ProVerif?**
A) They are executed in parallel with processes in the higher phase.
B) They are discarded and processes in the higher phase are executed.
C) They are suspended until the higher phase is reached.
D) They are executed before processes in the higher phase.

**Answer:** B
