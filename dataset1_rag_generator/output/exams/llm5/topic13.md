---
**1. What is the purpose of the "forall" keyword in the given formalism?**
A) To declare a new variable or name.  
B) To universally quantify variables in a clause.

**2. What happens when F1,..., Fm, F contain no variables in a clause?**
A) The "forall" keyword must still be used.  
B) The "forall" keyword can be omitted.  
C) The clause is considered invalid.  
D) The variables are assumed to be universally quantified.  
**Answer:** B

---
**3. What is the meaning of "t or fail" in the context of variable types?**
A) The variable can take any value except fail.  
B) The variable can take the special value fail in addition to its normal type.  
C) The variable can only take the value fail.  
D) The variable cannot take the value fail.  
**Answer:** B

---
**4. How are names represented in the given formalism when they are in the scope of variables?**
A) Without arguments, e.g. a[ ].  
B) With arguments, e.g. b[x=M, y=N].  
C) As a single identifier, e.g. c.  
D) As a function symbol, e.g. f(x, y).  
**Answer:** B

---
**5. What is the purpose of annotating restrictions with variables in the internal representation of fresh names?**
A) To avoid confusion between names and variables.  
B) To ensure that matching names have the same arguments.  
C) To specify the type of a variable or name.  
D) To universally quantify variables in a clause.  
**Answer:** B

---
**6. What is the convention for omitting "else 0" in the if-then-else construct?**
A) It is always omitted.  
B) It is never omitted.  
C) It is omitted only when the "if" statement is nested.  
D) It is omitted only when the "else" clause is empty.  
**Answer:** D

---
**7. What is the purpose of the "[precise]" annotation for inputs?**
A) To specify the type of a variable or name.  
B) To universally quantify variables in a clause.  
C) To ensure that the input is taken into account as precisely as possible.  
D) To avoid confusion between names and variables.  
**Answer:** C

---
**8. What is the format of the input file in the given formalism?**

B) A list of processes followed by the keyword "declaration" and a declaration.  
C) A single declaration followed by the keyword "process" and a process.  
D) A single process followed by the keyword "declaration" and a declaration.  
**Answer:** A

---
**9. What is the purpose of the "type" keyword in the given formalism?**
A) To declare a new variable or name.  
B) To specify the type of a variable or name.

**Answer:** B

---
