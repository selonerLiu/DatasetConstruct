# topic：Structural Units: Organization of processes and process macros into larger code blocks to implement protocol workflows.Definition and usage methods for processes and process macros in ProVerif.

Here are 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided content, designed to test students' understanding of process macros and structural units in ProVerif:

---

**1. What is the primary purpose of process macros in ProVerif?**  
A) To replace cryptographic primitives with simpler constructs.  
B) To define reusable sub-processes for easier protocol development.  
C) To enforce type checking on free variables.  
D) To eliminate the need for a main process.  
**Answer:** B

**2. How is a process macro formally declared in ProVerif?**  
A) `macro R(x1:t1, ..., xn:tn) := P`  
B) `let R(x1:t1, ..., xn:tn) = P`  
C) `def R(x1:t1, ..., xn:tn) { P }`  
D) `process R(x1:t1, ..., xn:tn) -> P`  
**Answer:** B  

---

**3. What happens during the expansion of a macro `R(M1, ..., Mn)`?**  
A) The macro name `R` is replaced with `P`, ignoring arguments.  
B) `P` is substituted with `M1, ..., Mn` replacing its free variables.  
C) The process `P` is executed first, followed by the main process.  
D) The macro is validated against cryptographic primitives.  
**Answer:** B

**4. Which of the following must be declared before use in a ProVerif process?**  
A) Only free names.  
B) Only variables in macros.  
C) Free names, types, and constructors.  
D) Destructors and phase numbers.  
**Answer:** C  

---

**5. What is the role of `phase n; P` in ProVerif?**  
A) It terminates all processes not in phase `n`.  
B) It synchronizes processes globally by advancing to phase `n`.  
C) It encrypts messages sent during phase `n`.  
D) It defines a macro for phase-specific sub-processes.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**6. How does ProVerif handle macros in the final interpreted process?**  
A) Macros are retained as-is for readability.  
B) Macros are expanded, and names/variables are given unique identifiers.  
C) Macros are replaced with Horn clauses.  
D) Macros are removed if unused in the main process.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**7. In the example `let R'(y:bitstring) = 0`, what does `0` represent?**  
A) A null cryptographic primitive.  
B) A terminated or empty process.  
C) A placeholder for phase synchronization.  
D) An error in macro definition.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**8. What is the effect of omitting macro definitions and expanding them directly in the main process?**  
A) It alters the protocol’s security properties.  
B) It makes no semantic difference but may reduce readability.  
C) It forces ProVerif to use tree automata.  
D) It invalidates type declarations.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. Which construct is used to declare a free name `n` of type `t` in ProVerif?**  
A) `free n : t`  
B) `name n : t`  
C) `let n : t`  
D) `declare n : t`  
**Answer:** A  

---

**10. What does ProVerif annotate in the interpreted process output to help users debug scope issues?**  
A) Phase numbers next to each process.  
B) Unique identifiers `{n}` for program points.  
C) Macro expansion timestamps.  
D) Cryptographic primitive signatures.  
**Answer:** B
