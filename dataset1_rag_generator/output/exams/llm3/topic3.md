# topicï¼šIdentifiers: Specifications for constructing variable/function names: Character set, First-character rules, Length restrictions, Keyword reservation policies, and so on.

Here are 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided content, designed to test students' understanding of identifiers in the given formalism:

---

**1. Which of the following is a valid rule for constructing identifiers in the given formalism?**  
A) Identifiers must begin with a digit.  
B) Identifiers must begin with a letter and can include underscores and digits.  
C) Identifiers cannot include letters from the ISO Latin 1 character set.  
D) Identifiers are case-insensitive.  
**Answer:** B

**2. What is the primary distinction between names (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`) and variables (e.g., `x`, `y`, `z`) in this formalism?**  
A) Names represent atomic data like keys, while variables can be substituted by terms.  
B) Variables represent atomic data, while names can be substituted by terms.  
C) Names and variables are interchangeable.  
D) Variables must always be declared with a destructor type.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**3. Which of the following is NOT allowed as the first character of an identifier?**  
A) A lowercase letter (e.g., `a`).  
B) An underscore (`_`).  
C) An uppercase letter (e.g., `A`).  
D) A digit (e.g., `1`).  
**Answer:** D

**4. How are reserved words (e.g., `channel`, `let`, `type`) treated in the formalism?**  
A) They can be used as identifiers if declared with a special keyword.  
B) They cannot be used as identifiers under any circumstances.  
C) They are case-insensitive, so variations like `CHANNEL` are allowed.  
D) They are only reserved when used in destructor applications.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**5. Which of the following is a valid identifier in the formalism?**  
A) `1key`  
B) `_private`  
C) `let` (reserved word)  
D) `nonce'123`  
**Answer:** D  

---

**6. What is the requirement for declaring names and variables in the formalism?**  
A) They must be declared with their type before use.  
B) Names must be declared, but variables can be used freely.  
C) Only variables used in destructors need declarations.  
D) Declaration is optional for names but mandatory for variables.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**7. Which character set is allowed in identifiers beyond letters and digits?**  
A) Only underscores (`_`).  
B) Underscores (`_`), single-quotes (`'`), and ISO Latin 1 accented letters.  
C) Only ISO Latin 1 accented letters.  
D) Special symbols like `@` and `#`.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**8. What happens if an identifier matches a reserved word (e.g., `process`)?**  
A) It is treated as a variable if declared with a type.  
B) It causes a syntax error because reserved words cannot be identifiers.  
C) It is allowed if used in a constructor application.  
D) It is automatically renamed by the parser.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. Which of the following is true about the case sensitivity of identifiers?**  
A) Identifiers are case-insensitive (e.g., `Key` and `key` are the same).  
B) Identifiers are case-sensitive (e.g., `Key` and `key` are distinct).  
C) Only variables are case-sensitive; names are not.  
D) Case sensitivity depends on the type of the identifier.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**10. In the formalism, which of the following is discouraged but technically allowed?**  
A) Using reserved words as identifiers.  
B) Using built-in type names (e.g., `nat`, `bool`) as identifiers.  
C) Using underscores in identifiers.  
D) Using numbers as the first character of an identifier.  
**Answer:** B

These questions cover key aspects of identifiers, including syntax, declaration rules, reserved words, and character sets, while providing plausible distractors.
