# topic：Parameter Matching: Function/destructor call requirements(Parameter count matching, Type consistency), Destructor-function constraints.

Here are 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided content, designed to test understanding of **Parameter Matching: Function/destructor call requirements** and **Destructor-function constraints**:

---

**1. What is a key requirement for the arguments of a destructor in rewrite rules?**  
A) They must be of arbitrary types.  
B) They must have the same type as the corresponding arguments in all other rewrite rules for that destructor.  
C) They must always include at least one variable.  
D) Their types can differ as long as the return type is consistent.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**2. When does a destructor term fail during evaluation?**  
A) If any of its arguments is a constructor term.  
B) If no rewrite rule applies to the term.  
C) If the term contains a may-fail constructor.  
D) If the term is nested inside another destructor.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**3. What defines a "simple pattern" in pattern-matching?**  
A) It contains no destructor symbols, and all `=D` occurrences use may-fail constructor terms.  
B) It must include at least one destructor symbol.  
C) It can only match tuples.  
D) It ignores type consistency.  
**Answer:** A  

---

**4. How are data constructors distinguished from other constructors?**  
A) They have no associated destructors.  
B) They come with associated destructors (e.g., `gi(f(x1,...,xn)) → xi`).  
C) They can only be used in conditional statements.  
D) They must return a boolean value.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**5. What is a requirement for the return type of a destructor across its rewrite rules?**  
A) Each rule can return a different type.  
B) All rules must return the same type as `M1,0`.  
C) The return type must match the type of the first argument.  
D) Return types are irrelevant for destructors.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**6. What happens during pattern-matching if a term `M` contains a destructor that fails?**  
A) The matching succeeds with a default value.  
B) The matching fails.  
C) The destructor is skipped, and the rest of the term is evaluated.  
D) The term is automatically converted to a constructor term.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**7. What is true about the `equal` destructor in the simplified ProVerif language?**  
A) It can occur anywhere in terms.  
B) It is the only allowed destructor and must only appear in conditionals (`M = N`).  
C) It can be used to define new function symbols.  
D) It ignores type consistency.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**8. What is a constraint on type converter functions during pattern-matching?**  
A) They must return the same type as their argument.  
B) Their application must be identifiable, and their output must differ from inputs/other converters.  
C) They can only be applied to tuples.  
D) They are exempt from type-checking.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. In a `let x = M in P else Q` statement, what happens if `M` contains a failing destructor?**  
A) `P` is executed with `x` bound to a default value.  
B) `Q` is executed.  
C) The process terminates abruptly.  
D) `M` is retried with the next applicable rewrite rule.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**10. What is a requirement for the arguments of a function macro in ProVerif?**  
A) They must all be destructor terms.  
B) They must match the parameter count and types declared in the macro definition.  
C) Macros cannot have arguments.  
D) Argument types are inferred dynamically.  
**Answer:** B
