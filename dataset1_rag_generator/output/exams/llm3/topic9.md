**1. What is the primary role of destructors in the given formalism?**  
A) To create new terms by combining variables and names.  
B) To manipulate terms through predefined rewrite rules.  
C) To replace constructors in all term-building operations.  
D) To declare new types for free names.  
**Answer:** B

**2. How are destructor function symbols typically declared in the system?**  
A) Using the syntax `free g : t`.  
B) Via `reduc` rules or `fun` declarations with `reduc`.  
C) By assigning them to variables directly.  
D) They do not require declaration and are built-in.  
**Answer:** B

**3. What is the key difference between constructors and destructors?**  
A) Constructors can only fail, while destructors always succeed.  
B) Constructors build terms, while destructors manipulate terms via rewrite rules.  
C) Constructors are optional, while destructors are mandatory.  
D) Destructors are used for type declarations, while constructors are not.  
**Answer:** B

**4. Which of the following is a valid way to define a constant in the system?**  
A) `free c : t`.  
B) `const c : t`.  
C) `reduc c() : t`.  
D) `fun c : t`.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**5. What happens if no rewrite rule applies to a destructor’s input?**  
A) The destructor returns a random term.  
B) The destructor fails.  
C) The destructor defaults to the first constructor.  
D) The system prompts for manual input.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**6. How are user-defined types introduced in the system?**  
A) Using `free t : type`.  
B) Via `type t.`.  
C) Through `fun t() : type`.  
D) They are inferred automatically.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**7. Which of the following is NOT a built-in constructor or destructor?**  
A) `true` (constructor).  
B) `&&` (destructor).  
C) `modular exponentiation` (destructor).  
D) `+1` (constructor).  
**Answer:** C  

---

**8. What is the purpose of the `forall` clause in destructor rewrite rules?**  
A) To restrict the scope of the destructor to specific types.  
B) To universally quantify variables used in the rule’s terms.  
C) To declare free names globally.  
D) To define conditional execution of processes.  
**Answer:** B  

---

**9. In the declaration `fun g(T1,...,Tn) : T`, what does `g` represent?**  
A) A free name of type `T`.  
B) A constructor function symbol.  
C) A destructor or constructor function symbol.  
D) A variable substitution rule.  
**Answer:** C  

---

**10. Which limitation of destructors is highlighted in the content?**  
A) They cannot handle atomic data like nonces.  
B) They cannot directly represent modular exponentiation.  
C) They require manual type inference.  
D) They are incompatible with free names.  
**Answer:** B
