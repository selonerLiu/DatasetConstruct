D) `free c : t.`  
**Answer:** B

D) They can be used without declaration.  
**Answer:** C

**4. What does the function declaration `h(T1,...,Tn) : T` indicate?**  
A) `h` is a destructor returning type `T`.

D) `nat`  
**Answer:** C

**6. What is the purpose of the `type t.` declaration?**  
A) To define a destructor.
