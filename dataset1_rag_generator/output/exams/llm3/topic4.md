# topic：Keywords: Character sequences with special syntactic meaning (e.g., if, event, function, free), including their semantic roles.

Here are 10 multiple-choice questions designed to test students' understanding of the topic "Keywords: Character sequences with special syntactic meaning (e.g., if, event, function, free), including their semantic roles":

---

**1. Which of the following is a valid identifier according to the given character set rules?**  
A) `1variable`  
B) `_private`  
C) `channel`  
D) `DataValue`  
**Answer:** D (A starts with a digit, B starts with an underscore, `channel` is a reserved word)

---

**2. What is the role of the reserved word `channel` in the grammar?**  
A) It denotes a type identifier (`⟨typeid⟩`).  
B) It is used to declare process communication.  
C) It represents a mathematical operator.  
D) It is a placeholder for natural numbers.  
**Answer:** A (From `⟨typeid⟩` definition: identifiers or the reserved word `channel`)

---

**3. Which of the following is NOT a reserved word or keyword in the given grammar?**  
A) `event`  
B) `let`  
C) `private`  
D) `calculate`  
**Answer:** D (Not mentioned as a reserved word; others are explicitly used in grammar rules)

---

**4. How are identifiers distinguished from reserved words in the grammar?**  
A) Reserved words are always uppercase.  
B) Identifiers cannot overlap with reserved words.  
C) Reserved words are enclosed in `⟨ ⟩`.  
D) Identifiers must end with a digit.  
**Answer:** B (From the content: identifiers must be "distinct from the reserved words")

---

**5. Which of the following infix operators has the highest precedence?**  
A) `==>`  
B) `&&`  
C) `+`  
D) `=`  
**Answer:** C (From precedence list: `+` and `-` have higher precedence than `=`, `&&`, `==>`)

---

**6. What syntactic category does `inj-event` belong to?**  
A) A reserved type identifier.  
B) A keyword for process synchronization.  
C) A function symbol in `⟨gterm⟩`.  
D) An infix operator.  
**Answer:** C (Used in `⟨gterm⟩` productions like `inj-event(seq⟨gterm⟩)`)

---

**7. In the grammar, what is the semantic role of the keyword `new`?**  
A) To declare a rewrite rule.  
B) To introduce a fresh variable (binding).  
C) To define a natural number constant.  
D) To mark a term as public.  
**Answer:** B (From `⟨gterm⟩` rule: `new ⟨ident⟩[[[⟨gbinding⟩]]]`)

---

**8. Which keyword is used to introduce a conditional term in `⟨gterm⟩`?**  
A) `if`  
B) `choice`  
C) `let`  
D) `==>`  
**Answer:** B (`choice[⟨gterm⟩,⟨gterm⟩]` is a construct for alternatives)

---

**9. What is the significance of the `fail` keyword in `⟨mayfailterm⟩`?**  
A) It indicates an error in type checking.  
B) It represents an explicit failure case in term evaluation.  
C) It is used to terminate processes.  
D) It marks a term as optional.  
**Answer:** B (From `⟨mayfailterm⟩ ::= ⟨term⟩ | fail`)

---

**10. Which reserved word is associated with declaring non-interference properties?**  
A) `noninterf`  
B) `private`  
C) `secret`  
D) `event`  
**Answer:** A (From the content: `noninterf [⟨typedecl⟩;] seq⟨nidecl⟩`)
