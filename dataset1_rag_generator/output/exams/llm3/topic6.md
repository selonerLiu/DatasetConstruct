A) It represents exactly one element of `⟨X⟩`.  
B) It represents one or more elements of `⟨X⟩` separated by commas.

D) It represents a reserved keyword.  
**Answer:** B

B) `// This is a comment`  
C) `# This is a comment #`  
D) `{ This is a comment }`  
**Answer:** A

**3. How are nested comments handled in the given formalism?**  
A) Nested comments are not allowed.  
B) Nested comments are supported (e.g., `(* (* nested *) *)`).  
C) Nested comments are only allowed if they use different delimiters.  
D) Nested comments are automatically flattened.  
**Answer:** B

**4. In the grammar rule `⟨gbinding⟩ ::= !⟨nat⟩ = ⟨gterm⟩ [; ⟨gbinding⟩]`, what is the role of the semicolon (`;`)?**  
A) It terminates the entire rule.  
B) It separates multiple `⟨gbinding⟩` declarations.  
C) It is optional and has no semantic meaning.  
D) It denotes a comment.  
**Answer:** B

**5. Which delimiter pair is used to group terms in the rule `| (seq⟨gterm⟩)`?**  
A) `[]`  
B) `{}`  
C) `()`  
D) `⟨⟩`  
**Answer:** C  

---

**6. What is the precedence order of the infix symbols `||`, `&&`, and `==>`?**  
A) `==>` has the highest precedence, followed by `&&`, then `||`.  
B) `||` has the highest precedence, followed by `&&`, then `==>`.  
C) `==>` has the lowest precedence, followed by `&&`, then `||`.  
D) `&&` has the highest precedence, followed by `||`, then `==>`.  
**Answer:** C

**7. In the rule `⟨failtypedecl⟩ ::= seq+⟨ident⟩: ⟨typeid⟩[or fail][,⟨failtypedecl⟩]`, what does the comma (`,`) signify?**  
A) It separates alternative declarations.  
B) It terminates the declaration.  
C) It separates multiple `⟨failtypedecl⟩` entries.  
D) It is a placeholder for optional text.  
**Answer:** C  

---

**8. Which of the following is a valid identifier according to the given rules?**  
A) `1variable`  
B) `_name`  
C) `VarName`  
D) `&&operator`  
**Answer:** C  

---

**9. In the I/O rule `E,P∪{{out(N,M); P,in(N,x); Q}},A`, what is the purpose of the semicolon (`;`)?**  
A) It separates parallel processes.  
B) It terminates the process declaration.  
C) It separates sequential actions within a process.  
D) It denotes a comment.  
**Answer:** C  

---

**10. How are function symbols like `&&` and `||` restricted in reduc and equation declarations?**  
A) They are allowed as constructors.  
B) They are allowed as destructors.  
C) They are not allowed; only constructors are permitted.  
D) They are allowed only in nested terms.  
**Answer:** C
