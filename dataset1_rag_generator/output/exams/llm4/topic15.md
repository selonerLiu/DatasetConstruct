**5. What does it mean for a process to preserve "strong secrecy" of a term M in ProVerif?**  
A) The term M must never be sent over the network.  
B) The adversary cannot distinguish between two versions of the protocol using different values of M.  
C) The term M must be encrypted at all times.  
D) The term M must be hashed before being used in any computation.  

**Answer:** B

---

**6. Which of the following best defines the role of an adversary in the symbolic model?**  
A) A passive observer who only eavesdrops on communications.  
B) An entity that can intercept, modify, and inject messages but can only compute using available cryptographic primitives.  
C) An all-powerful entity capable of breaking any encryption scheme.  
D) A trusted third party responsible for message routing.  

**Answer:** B

---

**7. Why are destructors not allowed in the term M when using the query `query attacker(M)` in ProVerif?**  
A) Because M must represent a final output rather than an intermediate step.  
B) Because M must be a ground term that the tool can fully analyze without needing to break it down further.  
C) Because destructors are computationally expensive and slow down the verification.  
D) Because destructors imply that the term has already been compromised.  

**Answer:** B

**8. Which of the following statements correctly reflects the relationship between secrecy and reachability in ProVerif?**  
A) Reachability is irrelevant to secrecy; they are separate concerns.  
B) Secrecy can be verified by checking whether a secret term is reachable by the attacker.  
C) Secrecy ensures that all terms are unreachable by the attacker.  
D) Reachability guarantees that all secrets are exposed.  

**Answer:** B

---

**9. What is the significance of including free names in the term M when testing secrecy in ProVerif?**  
A) Free names make the term more complex and harder to encrypt.  
B) Free names allow the representation of private or secret values that might be leaked to the adversary.  
C) Free names are automatically ignored during analysis.  
D) Free names ensure that the term is public by default.  

**Answer:** B

---
