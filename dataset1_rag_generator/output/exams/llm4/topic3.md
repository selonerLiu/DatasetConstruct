# topic：Identifiers: Specifications for constructing variable/function names: Character set, First-character rules, Length restrictions, Keyword reservation policies, and so on.

Here are 10 multiple-choice questions based on the provided content, focusing on **identifiers**, their **construction rules**, and related **naming conventions** in the context of formal verification (e.g., ProVerif):

**1. Which of the following characters is NOT allowed as the first character of an identifier in this formalism?**

A) An uppercase letter (e.g., 'A')  
B) A lowercase letter (e.g., 'a')  
C) A digit (e.g., '5')  
D) An underscore ( _ )  

**Answer:** C

**2. In the given language, what restriction applies to identifiers regarding reserved keywords?**

A) Reserved keywords can be used as variable names but not function names.  
B) Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifiers under any circumstances.  
C) Reserved keywords can be used only for built-in types like `bitstring`.  
D) Reserved keywords are case-insensitive and can be reused with different capitalization.  

**Answer:** B

**3. Which of the following identifiers would be considered valid according to the specification described?**

A) `my-variable`  
B) `_secretKey`  
C) `2ndAttempt`  
D) `channel`  

**Answer:** B

**4. What is a key difference between names (like `a`, `b`, `c`) and variables (like `x`, `y`, `z`) in this formalism?**

A) Names must always be lowercase, while variables can be uppercase or lowercase.  
B) Variables can be substituted by terms, but names represent fixed atomic data.  
C) Names and variables are interchangeable; the distinction is only conventional.  
D) Variables are restricted to numeric values, while names can be strings.  

**Answer:** B

**5. Based on the description, which of the following statements about may-fail variables is correct?**

A) They are a special kind of name that can evaluate to `fail`.  
B) They are a type of variable that can only appear in conditional expressions.  
C) They can be substituted by terms that might evaluate to the special constant `fail`.  
D) They are declared using the keyword `mayfail` and cannot be used in destructors.  

**Answer:** C

**6. According to the grammar of enriched terms, which of the following is a valid constructor or destructor application?**

A) `f(x, y, z)` where `f` is a function symbol  
B) `5 + x`  
C) `(x = y)`  
D) `new a : bitstring; a`  

**Answer:** A

**7. What is the significance of the notation ⟨typeid⟩ in the specification?**

A) It represents natural numbers used for indexing.  
B) It denotes integer values such as 5 or -3.  
C) It refers to types, which can be identifiers or the reserved word `channel`.  
D) It defines sequences of options like `[data, private]`.  

**Answer:** C

---

**8. Why do the authors recommend distinct naming of names and variables?**

A) To reduce memory usage during process execution.  
B) To improve performance in rewrite rules.  
C) To avoid confusion and ensure clarity in code.  
D) Because the system does not allow them to have similar spelling.  

**Answer:** C

---

**9. Which of the following best describes the naming policy for function symbols in this formalism?**

A) Function symbols must always start with a digit.  
B) Only single-letter identifiers can be used for functions.  
C) Function symbols are declared with their argument and result types.  
D) Function symbols cannot be overloaded or reused.  

**Answer:** C

---

**10. Which of the following identifiers would be considered invalid due to being a reserved keyword?**

A) `message`  
B) `attacker`  
C) `process`  
D) `secretKey`  

**Answer:** C
