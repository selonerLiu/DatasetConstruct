**1. Which of the following best describes the purpose of the `out(M, N); P` construct in ProVerif?**  
A) It receives a message from a channel and continues as process P.  
B) It sends a term N on channel M and then continues as process P.  
C) It evaluates the equality of terms M and N before proceeding.  
D) It restricts the scope of a new name used in P.  
**Answer:** B

**2. What is the function of the `0` (nil) process in ProVerif's process calculus?**  
A) It represents a process that infinitely replicates itself.  
B) It acts as a placeholder for undefined behavior.  
C) It does nothing and terminates immediately.  
D) It waits indefinitely for input on a channel.  
**Answer:** C

**3. How is conditional execution represented in ProVerif's process language?**  
A) `let x = M in P else Q`  
B) `new x : T; if M then P`  
C) `if M then P else Q`  
D) `phase 1; when M do P`  
**Answer:** C

**4. Which of the following constructs allows a process to receive a message on a channel in ProVerif?**  
A) `out(M, N); P`  
B) `in(M, x: t); P`  
C) `event(e(x)); P`  
D) `begin(x); P`  
**Answer:** B

**5. What does the replication operator `!P` signify in ProVerif?**  
A) The process P will run exactly once.  
B) The process P can be executed multiple times in parallel.  
C) The process P must terminate within a bounded time.  
D) The process P runs only if a certain condition holds.  
**Answer:** B

---

**6. In ProVerif, what is the primary use of the `new n : t; P` construct?**  
A) To declare a global constant of type t.  
B) To create a fresh name with restricted scope for use in P.  
C) To evaluate an expression involving names or variables.  
D) To define a function that returns a value of type t.  
**Answer:** B

**7. Which of the following best describes how control flow is managed in ProVerif processes?**  
A) Control flow is strictly linear with no branching or looping.  
B) Control flow is managed using constructs like `if-then-else`, replication, and phases.  
C) Control flow is determined entirely by external inputs and cannot be modeled internally.  
D) Control flow is modeled exclusively through cryptographic primitives.  
**Answer:** B

---

**8. What is the role of the `phase n; P` construct in ProVerif?**  
A) It delays the execution of P until after all other processes have completed.  
B) It ensures that P is executed in phase n and discards any processes not reaching this phase.  
C) It replicates P n times during execution.  
D) It binds a variable n to the process P for future reference.  
**Answer:** B

---

**9. Which of the following constructs is used to compose two processes so that they execute concurrently in ProVerif?**  
A) `P -> Q`  
B) `P | Q`  
C) `P + Q`  
D) `P ; Q`  
**Answer:** B

---

**10. What happens when a process reaches an `event(e(M1,...,Mn)); P` statement in ProVerif?**  
A) The process halts permanently.  
B) The event is recorded for verification purposes, and the process continues as P.  
C) The process is replicated n times.  
D) The process enters a new phase and restarts.  
**Answer:** B
