**1. What is the primary purpose of using correspondence assertions in the context of authentication verification?**  
A) To ensure that messages are encrypted properly during protocol execution.  
B) To verify that specific events occur in a certain order or relationship during the protocol.

D) To simulate network attacks on the protocol.  
**Answer:** B

**2. Which of the following best describes how ProVerif verifies authentication properties?**

D) Each session must be identical to the previous one.  
**Answer:** B

**7. What does it mean when a correspondence assertion states: "If event e₁ has occurred, then event e₂ must have occurred or will occur"?**  
A) It ensures that both events happen simultaneously.  
B) It establishes a causal or temporal dependency between the two events.  
C) It guarantees that e₂ happens before e₁.  
D) It proves that e₁ and e₂ are mutually exclusive.  
**Answer:** B

C) Tamarin cannot handle unbounded message spaces.  
D) Tamarin is limited to bounded session analysis.  
**Answer:** B
