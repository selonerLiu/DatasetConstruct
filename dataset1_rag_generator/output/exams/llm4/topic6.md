**2. In the given formalism, how are sequences of terms separated by commas (e.g., `seq⟨gterm⟩`) interpreted?**  
A) As a single atomic expression without internal structure.  
B) As one or more instances of the enclosed non-terminal ⟨gterm⟩, separated by commas.  
C) As a list where each element must be enclosed in curly braces `{}`.  
D) As a binary operation involving two ⟨gterm⟩ expressions.  

**Answer:** B

**3. What is the role of square brackets `[]` in the syntax rule `⟨gbinding⟩ ::= !⟨nat⟩ = ⟨gterm⟩ [; ⟨gbinding⟩]`?**  
A) They denote optional parts of the grammar.  
B) They enclose mandatory components of the production.  
C) They represent repetition of the enclosed element zero or more times.  
D) They are used for grouping expressions similar to parentheses.  

**Answer:** A

**4. In the context of this grammar, what does the vertical bar `|` symbol signify when it appears at the beginning of a line?**  
A) It indicates a comment or annotation meant for documentation.  
B) It separates different alternatives in a production rule.  
C) It represents a logical OR between two expressions.  
D) It denotes a continuation of the previous line's rule.  

**Answer:** B

**5. Which of the following correctly explains the use of the semicolon `;` in the grammar rule `⟨gbinding⟩ ::= ⟨ident⟩ = ⟨gterm⟩ [; ⟨gbinding⟩]`?**  
A) It separates unrelated declarations and has no syntactic significance.  
B) It serves as a delimiter between successive bindings in a sequence.  
C) It always terminates a statement and requires a newline after it.  
D) It is used exclusively for separating arguments in function calls.  

**Answer:** B

---

**6. How are angle brackets ⟨ ⟩ used in this formal grammar notation?**  
A) To enclose literal characters that appear directly in the input.  
B) To denote non-terminal symbols in the grammar.  
C) To indicate optional parameters in function definitions.  
D) To define terminal symbols such as reserved keywords.  

**Answer:** B

---

**7. In the phrase `new ⟨ident⟩[[[⟨gbinding⟩]]]`, what does the triple bracket `[[[ ]] ]` indicate?**  
A) That the contents are comments and should be ignored.  
B) That the ⟨gbinding⟩ is required and must appear exactly once.  
C) That the ⟨gbinding⟩ is optional and may be repeated multiple times.  
D) That the ⟨gbinding⟩ must be enclosed within square brackets.  

**Answer:** C

---

**8. What is the correct interpretation of the dot `.` in the declaration `noninterf [⟨typedecl⟩;] seq⟨nidecl⟩.`?**  
A) It is a placeholder for an omitted part of the rule.  
B) It marks the end of the declaration.  
C) It represents a decimal point in numeric literals.  
D) It is used to separate clauses within a function definition.  

**Answer:** B

---

**9. Based on the grammar, which of the following delimiters is used to denote nested comments?**  
A) `{ }`  
B) `( )`  
C) `(* *)`  
D) `[ ]`  

**Answer:** C

---

**10. Why are delimiters like parentheses and brackets important in defining the structure of grammar rules?**  
A) They have no real impact on the structure or meaning of the grammar.  
B) They allow for ambiguity by permitting multiple interpretations of the same rule.  
C) They enforce strict operator precedence and clarify grouping of elements.  
D) They are only used for visual formatting and can be removed safely.  

**Answer:** C
