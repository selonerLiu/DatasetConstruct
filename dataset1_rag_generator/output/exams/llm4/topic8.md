**1. In ProVerif, how must all free names appearing in an input file be declared?**  
A) They can be used without any declaration.  
B) Using the syntax `type n : t`.  
C) Using the syntax `free n : t`.  
D) By assigning them directly within a process expression.  

**Answer:** C

**2. What is the correct way to declare a constant of type `t` in ProVerif?**  
A) `fun c() : t.`  
B) `const c : t.`  
C) `let c = t.`  
D) `c : t.`  

**Answer:** B

**3. Which of the following best describes the role of variables in ProVerif?**  
A) Variables represent atomic data such as keys or nonces and cannot be substituted.  
B) Variables can be substituted by terms during execution.  
C) Variables are only used for defining types and not for computation.  
D) Variables are always global and cannot be bound locally.  

**Answer:** B

---

**4. How are user-defined types introduced in ProVerif?**  
A) With the keyword `typedef`.  
B) With the keyword `type`, followed by the type name.  
C) By using built-in types like `bitstring`.  
D) Automatically when declaring functions.  

**Answer:** B

---

**5. What is the purpose of function symbols in ProVerif?**  
A) To define processes that perform network communication.  
B) To serve as constructors or destructors for data manipulation.  
C) To restrict the use of built-in types like `bool`.  
D) To generate random values like nonces or keys.  

**Answer:** B

---

**6. What does the syntax `h(T1, ..., Tn) : T` indicate about a function symbol `h`?**  
A) It indicates that `h` is a variable with no arguments.  
B) It specifies that `h` takes `n` arguments of types `T1` through `Tn` and returns a value of type `T`.  
C) It defines `h` as a constant of type `T`.  
D) It declares `h` as a channel used for message passing.  

**Answer:** B

---

**7. Which identifiers typically represent names in ProVerif?**  
A) x, y, z  
B) f, g, h  
C) a, b, c, k  
D) i, j, n  

**Answer:** C

---

**8. What is the significance of the `const` declaration compared to defining a constant using `fun`?**  
A) There is no difference; both are equivalent.  
B) `const` allows the constant to be redefined later.  
C) `const` is a specific construct for constants, while `fun c() : t` defines a nullary function.  
D) `fun` is the preferred method for declaring constants.  

**Answer:** C

---

**9. Which of the following is a built-in type in ProVerif?**  
A) `string`  
B) `int`  
C) `bitstring`  
D) `list`  

**Answer:** C

---

**10. What is the main purpose of declarations in ProVerif?**  
A) To execute protocol simulations directly.  
B) To define types, constants, functions, and other constructs before they are used in processes.  
C) To optimize the runtime performance of cryptographic protocols.  
D) To provide comments for better code readability.  

**Answer:** B
