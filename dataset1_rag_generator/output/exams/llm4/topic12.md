**1. In ProVerif, what is the purpose of defining a process macro using the `let` syntax?**  
A) To permanently replace all variables with constants  
B) To define cryptographic primitives used in the protocol  
C) To simplify development by encapsulating sub-processes  
D) To enforce type checking across different phases  

**Answer:** C

**2. Which of the following correctly represents the structure of a process macro definition in ProVerif?**  
A) `let R = P(x1 : t1, ..., xn : tn)`  
B) `let R(x1 : t1, ..., xn : tn) = P`  
C) `def R(P) as let(x1,...,xn)`  
D) `macro R(x1, ..., xn) { P }`  

**Answer:** B

**3. When a process macro like `R(M1, ..., Mn)` is expanded in ProVerif, what happens to the variables `x1, ..., xn` defined in its declaration?**  
A) They are discarded after expansion  
B) They are automatically assigned global scope  
C) They are replaced by the corresponding arguments M1, ..., Mn  
D) They are converted into cryptographic keys  

**Answer:** C

---

**4. Why are macros considered useful but not essential in ProVerif models?**  
A) Because they only serve as comments and do not affect execution  
B) Because they can be omitted and manually expanded in the main process  
C) Because they are only applicable to symmetric cryptography  
D) Because they cannot be used inside replication constructs  

**Answer:** B

---

**5. How does the `phase` construct function in ProVerif when modeling multi-phase protocols?**  
A) It defines new cryptographic types for each phase  
B) It restricts variable visibility between phases  
C) It acts as a synchronization barrier that controls process execution order  
D) It prevents macros from being reused across phases  

**Answer:** C

---

**6. What is required before using any free name in a ProVerif input file?**  
A) It must be encrypted using a block cipher  
B) It must be declared with its type using the `free` keyword  
C) It must be associated with a destructor  
D) It must be replicated using the `!` operator  

**Answer:** B

---

**7. In ProVerif, what effect does the use of the `def` block have when defining security assumptions on primitives?**  
A) It creates a new type for each invocation  
B) It allows macros to be defined with local declarations  
C) It limits the scope of a macro to a single phase  
D) It enforces strict message ordering between processes  

**Answer:** B

---

**8. What does the phrase "strongly typed" imply in the context of ProVerif’s language?**  
A) Variables can change types during execution  
B) All names and variables must have a declared type  
C) Type declarations are optional but recommended  
D) Types are inferred automatically without user input  

**Answer:** B

---

**9. After macro expansion, how does ProVerif treat the resulting process?**  
A) It treats it differently from manually written processes  
B) It merges all processes into a single phase  
C) It assigns unique identifiers to expanded components  
D) It discards unused macros silently  

**Answer:** C

---

**10. Based on the material, which of the following best describes the role of process macros in protocol modeling?**  
A) They are solely used for documentation purposes  
B) They help organize complex processes into manageable and reusable components  
C) They are deprecated in newer versions of ProVerif  
D) They are only used for defining public keys  

**Answer:** B
